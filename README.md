# Well-Pick- E-commerce Website
A visually appealing e-commerce website design created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project presents a slightly responsive and interactive shopping interface, designed to mimic the look and feel of modern online marketplaces. While it doesn’t include backend functionality or payment integration, it highlights the capability of front-end technologies in creating engaging and practical web interfaces.

Features : Responsive Design - Optimized for a few different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Intuitive Layout - Includes navigation bars, product sections, cart icons, a shopping list upload feature, and an elegant footer. Designed with CSS to deliver a rich user experience using hover effects, transitions, and color schemes suited to a clean and modern shopping vibe.

Shop Through List (Unique Feature) : For Shopping Users can upload a list of prefered Items.

Technologies Used : HTML5 – For the structure and semantic layout of the web pages. CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsiveness using Flexbox and Grid. JavaScript - For interactive features, including the shopping list upload simulation and dynamic UI updates.

Future Goals : Integrate backend for user login, cart persistence, and order management. Improve mobile responsiveness across more device sizes. Add real payment gateway integration. Enable real-time cart management and wishlist features. Implement advanced search and category filtering.
